# ofxNodeGraph
Node Graph using ImGui

A node graph editor for openFrameworks!!! :) 

Basically ripped out the required code to get this working from the Graphics Tool Framework (GTF) https://github.com/Galloman/GTF/

Uses ofxImGui as a backend, find that here -> https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui

There is some weird mouse clicking behaviour in ofxImGui at the moment so i had to make the following modificaitons found here for everything to behave as expected -> https://github.com/rjx-ray/ofxImGui/commit/81c54a1499defc0f91f2d77ec7acff74fe9f36ce
